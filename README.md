# productivityComplacenyParadoxSurvey

This repository contains the template (`Survey.md` in the `Survey` folder) of the questionnaire used as part of my Master's Dissertation and the subsequent data later also used for a scientific article which is currently being prepared for publication.

This template was based upon the work of G. Sebastian (2023), who graciously included the full structure of his survey in his article. In the same spirit, I am providing here my own survey template for any to view and iterate upon should they so choose.

Should anyone wish to use it unaltered for their own non-commercial academic works, I wholeheartedly encourage them to do so. I concede that the provided template is by no means perfect, and encourage any future scholars to adapt and improve to suit their own needs.
